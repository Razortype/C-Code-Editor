    - All : compile all fetched files in given directory.
    - Settings : opens settings page.

<br />
When the start button is pressed system will be searching for C files in the given path and its childs. When all the information is gathered, files will be listed as table items. By double clicking it, items' data will appear right of the main page. File attributes demonstration can be changed in setting page.
<br />
<br />
The most import thing is structuring of C files. Fetched files also called by its folder name. Recommend design is that for every C file, another directory can be created. If that applied to your initial path, tracking files can be easier in editor.
<br />
<br />
After double clicking to selected item, file can be manipulated as wished.
